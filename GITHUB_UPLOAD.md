# Guide to Upload VisionX Project to GitHub

This guide will help you upload the VisionX project to GitHub, allowing others to access and contribute to the code.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Create a GitHub account: https://github.com/join
3. Set up SSH connection between Git and GitHub (optional, but recommended): https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

## Steps

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner, select "New repository"
3. Fill in the repository name as "VisionX"
4. Add description: "Decentralized platform combining AI visual analysis with Web3 technologies"
5. Choose public or private repository
6. Do not initialize the repository (don't add README, .gitignore, or license)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Initialize Git Repository Locally

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the VisionX project directory, and run these commands:

```bash
# Initialize local repository
git init

# Create .gitignore file to exclude files that don't need to be tracked
echo "node_modules/
.next/
out/
dist/
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
.env
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
.DS_Store" > .gitignore

# Add all files to staging area
git add .

# Commit initial code
git commit -m "Initial commit: VisionX MVP"
```

### 3. Link Local Repository to GitHub Repository

On the GitHub repository page, you'll see some commands. Use the following commands to link your local repository to the GitHub repository (make sure to replace the username in the URL):

```bash
# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/VisionX.git

# Rename the main branch to main (if you use main as your primary branch name)
git branch -M main

# Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Verify Upload

1. Refresh the GitHub repository page, you should see all uploaded files.
2. Check if any files were not correctly uploaded.

### 5. Continuous Project Updates

Each time you update the project, use these commands to push changes to GitHub:

```bash
# Add changed files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Describe your changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

## Add Team Members (If Needed)

1. On the GitHub repository page, click "Settings"
2. Click "Collaborators" or "Manage access" in the left menu
3. Click "Add people" or "Invite a collaborator"
4. Enter the GitHub username or email of the team member
5. Click "Add" or "Send invitation"

## Project Showcase and Documentation

Be sure to update the README.md file to include:

- Project overview and features
- Technology stack
- Installation and running guide
- Contribution guidelines
- License information

Adding screenshots or demo videos can help others better understand the project.

## Add GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want to showcase a project website, you can use GitHub Pages:

1. On the GitHub repository page, click "Settings"
2. Scroll to the "GitHub Pages" section
3. In the Source dropdown menu, select a branch (usually main)
4. Select the root directory or /docs folder
5. Click "Save"

After a few minutes, your site will be available at https://your-username.github.io/VisionX.
